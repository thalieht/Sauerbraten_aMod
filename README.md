Sauerbraten_aMod
================

A mod that adds:
* Friendlist '/fhelp' for commands
  * sound when a friend joins/leaves/talks (different talk sound from non-friends)
  * highlight friends in scoreboard
* sound when someone talks in public chat. Also different sound for teamchat.

* Changeable ingame rifle trail: color, width, duration, particle (ie use the trail from pistol)
  * Color can be per team or per trail (you can have up to 3 different trails at a time) or both. Each trail color can
    be adjusted seperately.
  * Width and duration are global for that kind of trail.
  * Particle: you can replace the smoke trail with snow, water, steam, flame or spark.
    You can also use a "lightning" as trail (when someone captures a flag) or/and "laser" as trail (pistol trail).
* Added different sounds per team for flag captures/drops/returns/resets/takes (can change them in aMod/sounds.cfg).
